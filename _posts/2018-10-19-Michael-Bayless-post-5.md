Our learning:

On monday, we for the most part just worked on our flags. a connection I could make between our learning as a whole and the flag projects could be that we have to learn how to break up complex problems into simpler ones, just like we have to break down the flags into simpler shapes in order to code them. on wednesday, we went over the requirements for the projects we're going to have to do later, and I believe we worked on our flags some more that day. some notable requirements for the project would be that we have to create a program and document the process. one connection I can make between the upcoming project and our future computer science classwork/learning or even a theoretical future as a software developer would be that to be good, programs that you make have to be well documented. on thursday, we worked on adding images and code with markdown, and on friday we mostly worked on our blogs, although on friday Mr. Allatta explained that the image and code adding we did on thursday was to explain our flag programs in our blog posts, so if you combine the learnings of thursday and friday a connection that you could make would be that these learnings are related to being able to explain what certain parts of a program do, and how they relate to the program as a whole, which is crucial to our learning in this class. <!--ellohell (see urbandictionary definition, second from the top) that was such a bs connection-->

My learning:

This week, I did some pretty decent classwork, at least in my opinion, although I didn't learn too much. The reason why I say I did good classwork was that I completed my flag. everyone else did relatively low effort flags, such as the flag of ghana. I chose the flag of the U.S.A (pictured below), and finished it on time, which I think shows that I can work efficiently, and that I can focus on getting work done. I used a technique to make the flag, which was grouping the stars together, so I didn't have to make 50 separate stars.
<br>
<code> twostar = overlay-xy(STAR,(250/6),0,STAR) </code>
<br>
this piece of code defines "twostar" as the combination of two stars with the overlay-xy function (which I learned on my own how to implement as a challenge for myself), put 250/6 units away from each other horizontally. 250 is the length of my union (blue part of flag), which is divided by 6, because there was an intention to put 6 stars per row, although I admit this only worked in the finished product because of luck and workarounds later on. in a different part of the code, two star is later combined with another twostar to make fourstar, combined with fourstar to make sixstar, and finally fourstar was combined with just one star to make fivestar. this section of code, in conjunction with the star rows that were produced with it, were a fundamental necessity for my flag, as there's no way that I'd make 50 individual stars. this is where the positive self reflection ends. one area for growth for making the flag would be making it realistic/to scale. I just eyeballed the flag's and its component's relative sizes, which makes the flag look kind of uneven, and definitely would look better if I did it to scale. back to the first sentence of this section, one reason I didn't learn much is that I couldn't make much sense of the programs Mr. Alatta shared with me after completing my flag. I understood the first one just fine, but the second one more or less stumped me. I tried looking up the usage of lambdas, but all I found were the halfway point of many online scheme courses, which used context sensitive uses of lamdas, which I would have to read prior lessons to understand. Another reason why I didn't learn much is that I just use the html tags instead of trying to use the markdown equivalents for code blocks and images. I suppose I should at least have tried to use the markdown versions, but in my opinion, learning multiple ways to do one thing if there's no (difference in use case/need to use a different method) is a waste, but and in the end, I didn't really learn much about markdown, which kind of goes against the intentions of the class, so I'll be sorry about that later probably.

A note for Mr. Allatta:
I'm not really sure if this clashes with your teaching philosophy, but I feel like an inclusion of a rubric for the blog posts, or even better, just spelling out the requirements for getting a 4 on blog posts would be a great help to everyone in the class. I feel like it might be a factor to why, as you stated, 10th grade doesn't do well on the blog posts, as they might feel that there's no way to do well, so they shouldn't try very hard. another reason why it could be a factor is that they don't have any way to judge theirselves, so they just to a minimal amount of effort and hope to get a decent grade. anyway, I would appreciate if you spelled out the requirements for getting a 4, because I want to make a better attempt to do well in your class.

P.S. should I replace all instances of "Mr. Allatta " with "you", as if you were the main reader of the blog post?





<!--
In this week's reflection, reflect on the process to design a program to display the geometry of a national flag. Reflect on the process to develop an original program. You must discuss at least two points in the process that were challenges or opportunities that you faced, including: decision steps, learning new functions, addressing feedback messages, or any other thinking work you did when designing your program.
Part 1: Our Learning
- Summarize the learning objectives and mastery skills for the week
- Make your own connections between concepts, activities, and objectives
 Part 2: My Learning
- Reflect on your personal contribution to the class
- Discuss your learning including struggles, questions, accomplishments, and needs for more support or more challenge
