Our learning:

On monday, we for the most part just worked on our flags. a connection I could make between our learning as a whole and the flag projects could be that we have to learn how to break up complex problems into simpler ones, just like we have to break down the flags into simpler shapes in order to code them. on wednesday, we went over the requirements for the projects we're going to have to do later. some notable requirements for the project would be that we have to create a program and document the process. one connection I can make between this and our future computer science classwork/learning or even a theoretical future as a software developer would be that to be good, programs that you make have to be well documented. on thursday, we worked on adding images and code with markdown.

A note for mr. allatta:
I'm not really sure if this clashes with your teaching philosophy, but I feel like an inclusion of a rubric for the blog posts, or even better, just spelling out the requirements for getting a 4 on blog posts would be a great help to everyone in the class. I feel like it might be a factor to why as you stated, our grade doesn't do well on the blog posts, as they might feel that there's no way to do well, so they shouldn't try very hard. another reason why it could be a factor

<!--
In this week's reflection, reflect on the process to design a program to display the geometry of a national flag. Reflect on the process to develop an original program. You must discuss at least two points in the process that were challenges or opportunities that you faced, including: decision steps, learning new functions, addressing feedback messages, or any other thinking work you did when designing your program.
Part 1: Our Learning
- Summarize the learning objectives and mastery skills for the week
- Make your own connections between concepts, activities, and objectives
 Part 2: My Learning
- Reflect on your personal contribution to the class
- Discuss your learning including struggles, questions, accomplishments, and needs for more support or more challenge
