my impressions of the course:

my impressions of the course are that so far, it is boring. All I've done so far is copy things into github. I dont really enjoy the idea of having to update a "learning blog" weekly either. I am, however, somewhat excited for learning new programming languages.

my learning:

So far, I haven't learned much. As previously stated, I haven't really done anything except copy things into github. although from that I have learned a little about the layout and workings of github. for example, I learned how to make repositories, and how to manipulate files and their systems within said repositories. Creating a github website also was a good refresh of past html/css knowledge.

my biggest challenge:

My biggest challenge so far would have to be not having my github website work. I Didn't notice a syntax error in my config file, and didn't notice it for three days. I thought that the github was taking a long time to push updates to the website. I finally noticed what went wrong when I checked my email and found out that error messages are sent by github via email for some strange reason. luckily I noticed that email, because if I didn't I probably wouldn't have a working website today.
