Part 1: Our Learning:

on wednesday, we spent class making flags. I chose to make the U.S.A. flag, because I wanted a challenge. I'm not really sure about how this relates to the bigger picture of our learning though, which I'm going to blame on being out sick for two out of the four classes last week. On thursday, we tried doing pair programming, which I think my partner and I did well, seeing as that by the end of the class, mostly everyone else seemed to be on the first few levels, while we just finished the second to last challenge. on friday, we mostly just went over the requirements for the blog posts and worked on making our blog posts.

Part 2: My learning:

I think I did well this week, because I didn't really fall too far behind for missing half of the week last week. I was making good progress on the flag, and I could finish it if I had another period to work on it. As I said previously, my teamwork was relatively decent, as I completed most of the pair programming challenges with my partner, not to mention I actually tried to work with him instead of doing it all myself. one thing I could improve was the blog post work, because I wrote almost nothing in friday's class, but at least I did this one, unlike last week's post.
