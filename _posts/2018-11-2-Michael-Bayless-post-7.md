our learning:
<br>
on monday, we began learning about functions. one connection I can make between functions and the concept that computer science is based in mathematics is that obviously, both programming and mathematics have functions, and in both versions functions take in values, modify that value, and then return the modified value. On wednesday, we mostly went over contracts and functions, and domains and ranges of functions. one connection I can make between the domain and ranges of functions and programming being related to mathematics is that like mathematical functions, programming functions also have domains and ranges, although in programming, domain and range refers to what types of data the function takes in and outputs, while in math domain and range refers to the set of values the graph of a function occupies. On thursday, we mostly worked on our function word problems, and the question, "what is the purpose of a contract" was asked. the answer to that question, is that contracts are outlines for what functions are supposed to do, and in pyret, they serve as a sort of basic test case.

my learning:
<br>
This week, there wasn't much to do. one thing that I did well this week was that I learned all of the things that were being taught, although I suppose I shouldn't be complimenting myself on that, since that's what you're expected to do at school. another thing that I did well would be that I didn't have to get taken away from working on the function word problems, because I was one of the few people who understood what a contract was. one area in which I could improve would have to be that I haven't yet realized the value of not doing your homework at the last second. another area in which I could improve is to flesh out my learning blog posts more.
