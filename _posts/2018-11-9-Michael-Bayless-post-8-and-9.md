our learning: 
<br>
On monday, we started learning about custom data types. one connection I can make from custom data types to mathematics would be that points (x,y), are another type of data. another connection I could make from data types and points to last year's computational algebra class would be that in the class, posns were the same things as points. on wednesday, we learned more about custom data types, and made functions that used the data types. one connection that I can make between custom data types and our data science unit would be that custom data types are just abstractions of tables. the reasoning for this would be that custom data types generalize the pattern that tables employ when items are grouped into rows, and thus create a more versatile form of combining pieces of data. on thursday, we worked on using examples/test cases to solve problems, and on friday, we solved a function word problem, and worked on our blog posts. the following week, we didn't have school on monday, and on tuesday, we went learned about solving questions with sets of data. on thursday, the class went on a trip, so there very obviously wasn't class, and on friday, we tried using coda.

This week was a good week for me. One area in which I did well is that I did well was that in friday's class, I was one of the few people to write a correct answer. another way in which I did well this week would be that I made reactors.<a href="https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1RXxZI_beTaGeUpWbi5mdvWex1xhD_y3o&v=be0f222"> I created the animation of the ball bouncing up and down, which was a fun challenge for me</a>. one area in which I could improve is that I'm still not using test cases and other means in my programs.
