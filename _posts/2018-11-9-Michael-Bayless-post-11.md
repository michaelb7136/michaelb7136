On monday, I started work on unit 3 of the data science unit, setting up functions and experimenting with new dot methods/accessors and chaining said methods/accessors. On wednesday, I learned how to make scatter-plots, which was difficult because I had to find out the contract for them on my own, and I finished unit 3. On thursday, I started work on unit 4, which entailed choosing a data set, and answering questions about how you could modify it. one connection I can make between being told to find questions you can ask about a data set and previous classwork is that we were previously asked to make questions you could answer with a data set, only now I can actually manipulate the data to recieve answers. On friday, I made functions that would modify the the data set according to the questions I answered.

This week, I did somewhat well. I completed a lot of work, although I did slack off slightly. I don't think that I did unit 3 the right way, because I sort of skipped the "table plan". I also didn't do any of the work at home, which is probably a lack of <i>some</i> virtue. I also submitted the blog post a little late, but that was because my family dragged me along to go see santa on sunday, which was when I was planning to do the blog post. overall, I think I am doing well, because I am slightly ahead of my schedule, which is one unit per week.
