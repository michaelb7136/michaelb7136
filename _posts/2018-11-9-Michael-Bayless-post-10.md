what I did this week:
<br>
on monday and wednesday, I worked on parameterizing my flag project. one connection that I can make between parameterizing my flag and one of the two projects that we have to do for this class would be that the program that I made would be a good example of a project I could have turned in. on thursday, I went through the requirements for one of the computer science projects. on friday, I discussed self-study plans with mr. allatta.

my learning:
<br>
this week, I didn't do very much. I parameterized my flag program to make it a function, and furthermore take in a size and make a flag of said size, although I'm not really sure If I did it correctly, because I just encased my existing program in a function and multiplied the existing values by the size variable, which feels like cheating. One area in which I did well is that I understand the requirements for the project better, which will most likely help me in the future. I anticipate that I will have a hard time choosing what the project will be, since I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that the teacher isn't allowed to provide ideas for what to do, and I'm bad at making decisions.  one area in which I could improve would be that I should have started working on the data science units over the weekend. another area in which I could improve is that this week's blog post is relatively lacking. I'm also not very sure how I'm supposed to structure these blog posts, now that I'm supposed to be documenting my self studies.
