my impressions of the course:

I'm still pretty bored with whats happening in class. We did sort of start learning a new language, but not much of it. I did, however, start working on learning the language on my own, but I'll save that for the "my learning" section. I feel that this class is sort of slow paced, at least, in my opinion. 

my learning:

As I mentioned previously, I started learning a new language, called pyret. I've learned how to make functions in pyret on my own, and now I should probably figure out how reactors and data types work. I'm kind of dissapointed that I have to resort to learning on my own, because if I wanted to learn on my own, I could just drop out, and then I wouldn't be forced to socialize with other people.

my biggest challenge:

I guess there aren't many serious challenges or obstacles for me to overcome. I do, probably need to work on my teamwork/collaboration skills, because according to everyone ever, if you dont have social skills, you're never going to succeed in life, and furthermore going to die a painful lonely death.
